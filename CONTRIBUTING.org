Thanks for considering contributing to Dinwiddy!

** Caches

It may interest those using Nix to develop Dinwiddy, that we use the =idris2-pkgs= Cachix cache to eliminate rebuilding all of Idris. With =cachix= installed, running the following will enable cached builds:

#+begin_src
cachix use cm-idris2-pkgs
#+end_src

For more information, see [[https://github.com/claymager/idris2-pkgs][claymager/idris2-pkgs]].
